	Added option to read in bootcode from a file so that if you have
	for example Windows 2000 boot code, you can have it write that
	as the bootcode.  This is a dump of the behinning of a partition
	generally 512 bytes, but can be up to reserved sectors*512 bytes.
        Also writes 0x80 as the	BIOS drive number if we are formatting a
	hard drive, and sets the number of hidden sectors to be the
	number of sectors in one track. These were required so that DOS
	could boot using the bootcode.

	Better algorithm to select cluster sizes on large filesystems.
	Added bogus boot sector code that on attempts to boot prints a
	message (which can be chosen at mkdosfs time) and lets the user
	press any key and try again.  Corrected support for 1.2 Mb
	floppies.  mkdosfs now generates the extended bootsector
	(superblock) format of DOS 3.3+, with support for volume ID's and
	volume labels (volume labels are also written to the root
	directory, as they should).
