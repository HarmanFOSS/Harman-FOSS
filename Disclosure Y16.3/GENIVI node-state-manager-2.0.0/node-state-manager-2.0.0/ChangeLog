19th Sep. 2013, Jean-Pierre Bogler:
  - Temporary fix to return the ApplicationMode
    in which we initially were in and not the 
    ApplicationMode that recently was set.
  - Added dependency to pas-daemon.service to
    assert stable PCL handling.
    
09th Sep. 2013, Jean-Pierre Bogler:
  - Moved reading of "ApplicationMode" via PCL in 
    the "Getter function", since we can't use PCL 
    until the dbus interface is exported (because 
    the PCL needs the dbus interface to register)

  - Introduced PCL in NSM to store ApplicationMode
