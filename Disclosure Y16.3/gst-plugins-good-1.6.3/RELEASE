for the full release notes.



"Such ingratitude.  After all the times I've saved your life."


A collection of plugins you'd want to have right next to you on the
battlefield.  Shooting sharp and making no mistakes, these plugins have it
all: good looks, good code, and good licensing.  Documented and dressed up
in tests.  If you're looking for a role model to base your own plugin on,
here it is.


If you find a plot hole or a badly lip-synced line of code in them,
let us know - it is a matter of honour for us to ensure Blondie doesn't look
like he's been walking 100 miles through the desert without water.


This module contains a set of plugins that we consider to have good quality
  code, correct functionality, our preferred license (LGPL for the plugin
  code, LGPL or LGPL-compatible for the supporting library).
We believe distributors can safely ship these plugins.
People writing elements should base their code on these elements.


Other modules containing plugins are:


gst-plugins-base
contains a basic set of well-supported plugins
gst-plugins-ugly
contains a set of well-supported plugins, but might pose problems for
    distributors
gst-plugins-bad
contains a set of less supported plugins that haven't passed the
    rigorous quality testing we expect, or are still missing documentation
    and/or unit tests
gst-libav
contains a set of codecs plugins based on libav (formerly gst-ffmpeg)
