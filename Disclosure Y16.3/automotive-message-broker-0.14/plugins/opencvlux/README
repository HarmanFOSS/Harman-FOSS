# OpenCV "lux" plugin
Version: @PROJECT_VERSION@


# Introduction {#opencv_intro}

This plugin simulates the ExteriorBrigtness property using a traditional webcamera.  It works
by taking the mean pixel intensity of the web camera image and estimating lux.  The particular
can be calibrated using the "pixelUpperBound" and "pixelLowerBound" variables.


# Setup {#opencv_setup}

To enable the OpenCV "lux" plugin, run cmake and enable the opencvlux_plugin option:

cmake -Dopencvlux_plugin=On ..

Currently, this plugin has been tested with OpenCV 2.4.4.

To use the OpenCV plugin, add the following to the "sources" array in /etc/ambd/config:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.js}
{
  "name" : "OpenCV LUX",
  "path" : "@PLUGIN_INSTALL_PATH@/opencvluxplugin.so",
  "threaded" : "true",
  "pixelLowerBound" : "0",
  "pixelUpperBound" : "255",
  "fps" : "30",
  "opencl" : "false",
  "device" : "0"
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**NOTE:** some features require the qtmainloop to be running.  see the main README for details.

| "device"          | Camera to use.  The string "0" corrisponds to /dev/video0               | "0"                |
| "threaded"        | Compute pixel intensity in another thread.  Set to "true" or "false"    | "false"            |
| "fps"             | How many times per second to poll image data from the camera.           | "30"               |
| "opencl"          | (experimental) Use a specialized CPU/GPU device to help with processing | "false"            |
| "logging"         | Turn on video logging.                                                  | "false"            |
