libc-wrapper malloc/free tracing test
-------------------------------------

This test checks if tracing works correctly when applications are linked against
the UST libc wrapper which provides tracepoints in the malloc and free libc
functions.

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The test application performs a series of calls to malloc()/free() and the
resulting trace is checked for the presence of ust-libc:malloc and ust-libc:free
events.

DEPENDENCIES
------------

To run this test, you will need:

  - lttng-tools (with python bindings)
  - babeltrace
  - python 3.0 or better
