Fork tracing test
-------------------

This test checks if tracing works correctly in a child process created by a
fork() call, as well as after an exec() call.

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The test_fork script launches a binary that forks and calls exec() with
the command provided as the argument. Tracepoints are placed before and
after these calls to verify tracing remains operational at all times.

The binary loaded as the new process image also logs an event.

The resulting trace is parsed to make sure the every event was logged
successfully with the correct PIDs.

DEPENDENCIES
------------

To run this test, you will need:

  - lttng-tools (with python bindings)
  - babeltrace
  - python 3.0 or better
