UST linking test
----------------

Tests userspace tracing with directly, statically and dynamically linked
providers.

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This test checks that tracepoints can be enabled by using LD_PRELOAD inside a
launcher script. The test application is also compiled with tracepoint
providers linked directly and statically. The same test suite is executed
for every version of the binary.

The resulting trace is verified to make sure it is valid and contains the
expected valuess. This test also verifies that the execution of the demo test
without LD_PRELOAD has not produced any logged events.

Also serves as an example of building and tracing an application with all types
of provider linking.

DEPENDENCIES
------------

To run this test, you will need:

  - lttng-tools
  - babeltrace
  - python 3.0 or better
