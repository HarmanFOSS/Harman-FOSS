Test Source Plugin

The test source plugin tests the internal routing engine of AMB.  If there is an error, the test plugin will cause ambd to abort.
This plugin is useful when testing changes in AMB's core routing engine.

To use the Test Source plugin, add the following config to your /etc/ambd/config:


"sources" : [
		{
			"name" : "test",
			"path" : "/usr/lib/automotive-message-broker/testsourceplugin.so"
		}
	]
