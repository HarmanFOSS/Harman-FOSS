Hi!

Using an interesting SUSE idea of using a KDE service menu to add new
repositories into YaST, I've managed to code something similar for
Smart. I'm sending the necessary files attached:

* add_smart_channel.desktop
copy into <kdedir>/share/apps/konqueror/servicemenus/
(on SUSE it's /opt/kde3/share/apps/konqueror/servicemenus/)

* kde_add_smart_channel.sh
copy somwhere in your $PATH (don't forget to chmod 755!)

After that, you can right click on a directory under Konqueror and it will:

a) Detect what kind of packages you have there (either RPM or DEB)
b) Ask what kind of channel to add (RPM, DEB or Both)

Please, give me any feedbacks on it ok? I've not tested it too much, but
who knows what can happen? :)
