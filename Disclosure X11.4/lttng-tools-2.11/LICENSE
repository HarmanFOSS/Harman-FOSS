LTTng Tools licensing

* LGPLv2.1

The library part is distributed under LGPLv2.1. See lgpl-2.1.txt for details.
This applies to:

-) include/lttng/*
-) src/lib/lttng-ctl/*

We have some tests LGPL but should not impact anything even if we change them
in the future to GPL.

LGPL-compatible source code can statically use the library header using:

#define _LGPL_SOURCE
#include <lttng/lttng.h>

Dynamic-only linking with the LGPL library is used if _LGPL_SOURCE is not
defined. It permits relinking with newer versions of the library, which is
required by the LGPL license.

* GPLv2

All remaining source code is distributed under the GPLv2 license. See
gpl-2.0.txt for details.
