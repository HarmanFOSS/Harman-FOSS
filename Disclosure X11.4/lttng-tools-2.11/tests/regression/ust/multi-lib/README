Those test cases are designed to test the support for loading and unloading
probe providers and callsites at run time during tracing. One test case also
tests the event payload comparaison functions.

Testing build artefacts:
------------------------

./exec-with-callsites
	Test binary built with tracepoint callsites

./exec-without-callsites
	Test binary built without tracepoint callsites

/.libs/libprobe_*.so:
	Libraries containing slight variations of probe providers for the same
	tracepoint name. Note that the file /.libs/libprobes_a_prime.so has the same
	content as .libs/libprobes_a.so likewise for libprobes_c_prime.so

/.libs/libcallsites_*.so
  Libraries containing tracepoint callsites. The user must dlopen the library
  and use dlsym to get an handle on the function that calls the tracepoint.
