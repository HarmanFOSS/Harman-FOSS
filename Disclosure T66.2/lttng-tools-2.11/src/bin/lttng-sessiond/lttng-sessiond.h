 * This consumer daemon state is used to validate if a client command will be
 * able to reach the consumer. If not, the client is informed. For instance,
 * doing a "lttng start" when the consumer state is set to ERROR will return an
 * error to the client.
 *
 * The following example shows a possible race condition of this scheme:
 *
 * consumer thread error happens
 *                                    client cmd arrives
 *                                    client cmd checks state -> still OK
 * consumer thread exit, sets error
 *                                    client cmd try to talk to consumer
 *                                    ...
 *
 * However, since the consumer is a different daemon, we have no way of making
 * sure the command will reach it safely even with this state flag. This is why
 * we consider that up to the state validation during command processing, the
 * command is safe. After that, we can not guarantee the correctness of the
 * client request vis-a-vis the consumer.
