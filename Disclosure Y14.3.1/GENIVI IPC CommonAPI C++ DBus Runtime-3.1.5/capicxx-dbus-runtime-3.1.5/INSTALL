=== Patching libdbus

CommonAPI-D-Bus needs some api functions of libdbus which are not available in actual libdbus versions. For these additional api functions it is necessary to patch the required libdbus version with all the patches in the directory src/dbus-patches. Use autotools to build libdbus.

----
$ wget http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus/dbus-<VERSION>.tar.gz
$ tar -xzf dbus-<VERSION>.tar.gz
$ cd dbus-<VERSION>
$ patch -p1 < </path/to/CommonAPI-D-Bus/src/dbus-patches/patch-names>.patch 
$ ./configure --prefix=</path to your preferred installation folder for patched libdbus>
$ make -C dbus 
$ make -C dbus install
$ make install-pkgconfigDATA
----

You can change the installation directory by the prefix option or you can let it uninstalled (skip the +make install+ commands).
WARNING: Installing the patched libdbus to /usr/local can prevent your system from booting correctly at the next reboot.

=== Build CommonAPI-D-Bus Runtime

In order to build the CommonAPI-D-Bus Runtime library the pkgconfig files of the patched libdbus library must be added to the +PKG_CONFIG_PATH+.

For example, if the patched libdbus library is available in /usr/local, set the +PKG_CONFIG_PATH+ variable as follows:

----
$ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH" 
----

Now use CMake to build the CommonAPI D-Bus runtime library. We assume that your source directory is +common-api-dbus-runtime+:

----
$ cd common-api-dbus-runtime
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -D USE_INSTALLED_COMMONAPI=ON -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..
$ make
$ make install
----

You can change the installation directory by the CMake variable +CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX+ or you can let it uninstalled (skip the +make install+ command). If you want to use the uninstalled version of CommonAPI set the CMake variable USE_INSTALLED_COMMONAPI to OFF.

For further build instructions (build for windows, build documentation, tests etc.) please refer to the CommonAPI D-Bus tutorial.
