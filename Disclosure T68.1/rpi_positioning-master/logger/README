==================================
Author Helmut Schmidt <https://github.com/huirad>

Overview
--------
The positioning logger may be used to write data provided GNSSService and SensorsService to DLT, a file or another sink.
It is a tiny library without further dependencies which can be linked to each application.
It is agnostic of the data written to the log.
The positioning logger is not an official GENIVI component.
