Daemon tracing test
-------------------

This test checks if tracing works correctly in a child process created by a
call to daemon().

DESCRIPTION
-----------

A session daemon is launched if none are found to be running. The test_daemon
script then creates a session, enables all events from the userspace domain,
starts the session and launches the daemon binary.

The daemon binary, in turn, triggers tracepoints both from the original and
resulting daemon process.

The test_daemon script then parses the resulting trace and ensures that the
events were correctly recorded and were logged with the right PIDs.

DEPENDENCIES
------------

To run this test, you will need:

  - lttng-tools (with python bindings)
  - babeltrace
  - python 3.0 or better
