exit-fast tracing test
-------------------

This test verifies that tracing works correctly when the traced process exits
right after an event is logged.

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This test launches a process that logs an event and returns directly after.
It then launches it again in a mode that will trigger a SIGKILL right after
the tracepoint is executed. The resulting trace is then checked for errors.

The events must be present in the trace and contain the appropriate test string.

DEPENDENCIES
------------

To run this test, you will need:

  - lttng-tools (with python bindings)
  - babeltrace
  - python 3.0 or better
