# A current design limitation of the lttng-consumerd will cause it to
# hang on shutdown if the timer management thread exits as the teardown
# of channels switches off the channel's timers. The timer thread is
# then expected to purge timer signals and signal when it is done.
# Obviously this state will never be reached as signals are no longer
# being processed. This is not dramatic as this is not what this test
# is meant to test; we only want to make sure the health check signals that
# something went wrong.
