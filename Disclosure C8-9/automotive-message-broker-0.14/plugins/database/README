# Database plugin {#database_plugin}
Version: @PROJECT_VERSION@

This plugin logs properties in a sqlite database file.  It can also be used as a source to
play back previous logs to AMB.

To enable the Database plugin, run cmake and enable the database_plugin option:

cmake -Ddatabase_plugin=On ..

To use the Database plugin, add the following to the "sources" array in /etc/ambd/config:

  "path" : "@PLUGIN_INSTALL_PATH@/databasesinkplugin.so",
  "databaseFile" : "storage",
  "bufferLength" : "100",
  "properties" : "{ 'properties' : ['VehicleSpeed','EngineSpeed'] }",
  "startOnLoad" : "false",
  "playbackOnLoad" : "false",
  "playbackMultiplier" : "1",
  "frequency" : "1"
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Configuration Key Definitions:

"name"
