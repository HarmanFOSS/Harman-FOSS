Using the CMake build system under Unix
=======================================

briefly, do the following:

cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local .
make
make install

alternatively, you can also do an out of source build, if
you don't want to clutter the source tree with object files etc.

$ cd freepv
$ mkdir mybuild
$ cd mybuild
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ../
$ make
$ make install

Please report any problems to the Freepv-devel mailing list:
https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/freepv-devel


Missing dependencies
=======================
If cmake failed to pick up some dependencies, make sure you have
installed the corresponding development packages (often named:
libjpeg-dev and so on). If cmake still fails to find the libraries,
for example if you have installed them into a non-standard directory,
you can specify the path to libraries and include files using the
ccmake program:
$ cmake .
[some failure]
$ ccmake .

Configuring the build
=====================

Upon cmake invocation, several variables can be set with the -D command line
parameter. Important variables include:

CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX  Destination directory of make install 
                      (default: /usr/local)
LIB_SUFFIX            Specifies suffix used for library paths. For AMD64,
                      usually 64 is used as prefix. Default: empty.
                      Setting to 64 results in: $CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib64

For distributors:
=================
CMake supports the DESTDIR variable during make install, this
might be helpful to install into a temporary directory during
package creation

$ make install DESTDIR=mytmp_package_dir
