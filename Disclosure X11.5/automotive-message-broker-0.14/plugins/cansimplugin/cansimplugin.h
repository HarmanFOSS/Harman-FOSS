 *  \brief CANSimPlugin listens on configured CAN interfaces(e.g. vcan0, vcan1, ...) for CAN frames from CANGenPlugin and translates them into AMB property changes.
 *
 *  CANSimPlugin is a source plug-in for Automotive message broker(AMB). \n
 *  For the AMB library API please visit <a href="https://github.com/otcshare/automotive-message-broker">Automotive message broker web page</a>.\n
 *
 *  To load this plugin at AMB starup, insert following rows into AMB configuration file:
 *  \code
 *      {
 *          "name" : "CANSimPlugin",
 *          "path":"/usr/lib/automotive-message-broker/cansimplugin.so",
 *          "interfaces" : ["vcan0", "vcan1"]
 *      }
 *  \endcode
 *
 * \note CANSimPlugin has to be the last source plug-in listed in AMB configuration file. Otherwise it can accidentally unregister or try to simulate some AMB properties supported from other sources.
 *
 *  @{

/*!
 * \brief CAN frames listener plug-in for the AMB CAN Simulator.
 *
 *  Listens on AMB notification for changes in supported properties using supportedChanged() callback. \n
 *  On startup it registers property called 'MappingTable' and all properties needed for simulation in html5UI.Dashboard and html5UI.HVAC applications. \n
 *  Immediately after it registers own properties it will get first notification supportedChanged().\n
 *  On every notification from supportedChanged() CANSimPlugin goes through all supported properties in AMB, exclude those properties for which there are known sources in the AMB,\n
 *  assigns to each single property and zone some unique CAN Id(builds 'mapping table') and this 'mapping table' stores as JSON string and updates it as a 'MappingTable' property in AMB.\n
 *  When 'MappingTable' is built and ready it starts to listen on all required CAN interfaces in AMB configuration file.\n
 *  On any received CAN frame it goes through the mappingTable, finds property name and zone based on received CAN Id, reads new value from CAN frame and updates it in the AMB.
