/*
 * Define wrapper structure representing an optional value.
 *
 * This macro defines an "is_set" boolean field that must be checked
 * when accessing the optional field. This "is_set" field provides
 * the semantics that would be expected of a typical "raw pointer" field
 * which would be checked for NULL.
 *
 * Prefer using this macro where "special" values would be used, e.g.
 * -1ULL for uint64_t types.
 *
 * Declaration example:
 * struct my_struct {
 * 	int a;
 * 	LTTNG_OPTIONAL(int, b);
 * };
 *
 * Usage example:
 * struct my_struct foo = LTTNG_OPTIONAL_INIT;
 *
 * LTTNG_OPTIONAL_SET(&foo.b, 42);
 * if (foo.b.is_set) {
 * 	printf("%d", foo.b.value);
 * }
 *
 * LTTNG_OPTIONAL_UNSET(&foo.b);
